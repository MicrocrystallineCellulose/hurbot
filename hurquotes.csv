A hair-raising scream exploded from the dark. A thousand shrill blades that rang against the rock walls. Puncturing me. Ripping through my heart.
"I have loved you both from the very beginning before you were even born. Please, take care of each other."
"Her hand wandered, and I could hear the bark chafing under her palm. ""It was here,"" she whispered. ""This is where it happened."""
"Everything still ached. The cracks still gaped wide, cold wind blowing through. The lost were still lost. The dead, unrestored."
"Father was gone, truly gone. And I knew that no matter how long and how far I searched, there was nowhere I could go to hear his voice again."
"He continued to stare at me, a stare that was flat and unamused. ""Those that call themselves a 'nobody' are always people of significance. Or a person hiding a secret."""
"Then I heard it again, the wind that sounded so familiar- Father's voice, deep and melodic."
"""And what more is there?"" I asked quietly. Maewol sighed. ""I don't know for certain yet. All I hear are echoes from the other world; there is more than meets the eye."""
"We must learn to embrace the new seasons in our lives. There is a season to gain, a season to lose; a season for peace, a season for war; a season to laugh, a season to mourn, and to betray."
"Still, my feet moved forward, one step after the next."
It was strange how sadness reached so deeply into my chest for a man I had never spoken to.
"Perhaps, if I listened closely, I might even hear his heartbeat come from the depth of the sea."
How could I forget? How could I turn away?
I had so much fear in me.
There is one lesson all who enter the capital will learn: evil comes from the unfulfilled need for significance.
"When we believe, we hold on to what we think is true. But when we have a conviction, that truth holds on to us."
"I have loved you both from the very beginning before you were even born. Please, take care of each other."
"I kissed the sheet and then tore it in half, then in half again, the paper hissing with each motion. I opened my fingers and let the torn pieces be swept away like moths on the wind."
"There is such an assortment of people, an assortment of knowledge. And I realized that the answer to his strange condition was no great mystery."
"Doing what is right, it is so utterly terrifying. And yet so freeing."
"Everyone suspects everyone. So they dare not talk, not when everyone is watching. "
"Now I realized why Iâ€™d so struggled to understand this man. It was because Iâ€™d imagined evil as being made of horns, spikes, and sharp teeth, not glowing with the appearance of goodness and respectability. "
"I knew her. She was my daughter. And from the day of her death, all you saw was a crime to be solved. From that day, you disrespected my affection for my daughter, and even now, you speak to me with a cruel, impatient look in your eyes. "
"This is the consequence of the clash of old and new. We must prepare our hearts, all of us. No matter which side wins, we will all be heartbroken. "
"I would not love, unless I was loved first and loved the most. I would be nothing at all, if I could not be first. "
"When the time comes, you watch out for me. And I will always watch out for you. "
"Revenge begets revenge; the anger is unquenchable. We become the monsters we are trying to punish. Justice, however, brings closure, and that is what I want. "
All I can do is find enough evidence to make the truth undeniable. 
So she had been a tribute girl. She had lived through my worst nightmare. 
"Somewhere on Jeju, this island of wind and stone, between the ancient Gotjawal forest and the cloud-topped peaks of Mount Halla, my father had disappeared."
Who was she? Why had she sent the journal? How did she know my father?
"""I can tell you one thing in common about those missing girls."" The gentleman smoothed his thumb over the engraved design at the hilt of his sword. ""They were pretty."""
"""A moth pretends to be what it is not,"" he whispered to me, then only a child of seven winters. ""to escape from things that would hurt them."""
I had trusted him. I had believed him.
No one needed to believe me; I'd always done everything on my own after Mother's death.
" It was difficult to breathe, but I bowed my head, and so did Jieun. It was our duty to obey."
"Once, when a teacher had rebuked me for dalling asleep during a lesson, I'd learned to stay awake no matter what by pinching myself so hard that the skin would peel."
"I had seen death before, but never like this. Despite the straw mats covering the four bodies, I could see the tops of their neatly brushed hair, the tips of their still fingers, the hems of their uniforms."
The lingering scent of death soaked deep into my thoughts.
The thought that the truth was finally within our reach left me jittery.
"""I don't want to be a king. I will never be good enough,"" the prince continued, a desperate note trembling in his deep voice. ""I only ever wanted to be your son."""
"""And no matter what, if you value your life, do not say anything to upset His Highness."""
"I let out a slow breath to ease the ache in my chest. I hope your mother will love you one day, I wanted to whisper to the child. More than my own ever did. "
"The unfairness of it all had festered in me, and I could feel it rearing its head even now. An anger that would burst into little fires. "
"After I had been born, Mother would set me on the floor to play with dirt. But when my brother was born, she'd always carry him around."
"When I had grown older, she'd left me to be raised by a servant. But when my brother had grown older, she had surrounded him with tutors and rare honey-fried biscuits."
"""The shape of who you are is an image of heaven and earth."""
"""I thought I said I never wanted to see you again."""
"To be a boy opened doors that would never open for me, shielded him in a way where my own status as a woman had stripped me naked."
"""And that is how every love story begins."""
It wasn't the first time someone had remarked on our similarity.
"For among all the king's children, they were the most hated, and must have been companions in their shared misery."
"I kept as still as stone as I watched him, unable to blink or breathe, unable to look away."
"He was a handsome young man of fair complexion, a strong profile, and expressionless black eyes that absorbed the empty palace around him."
He moved with the grace of a deer but was built like a military general.
"""I am not the son you wish me to be, and I am very sorry for it."""
"I knew how to keep my heart calm in the face of death and dying, screaming patients, and yet one sharp word from my father, and I turned into a fragile child."
"Sometimes pulses were slippery, choppy, hesitant, or hollow."
"""One doesn't always need a sword to find the truth."""
"At the sight of Eojin, memories swept in, bright and flickering. Our promises whispered within the papered walls of the inn. Our long nights of discussion, questions that haunted us both."
Life seemed almost ordinary again.
October arrived in a splendor of red maple and vivid yellow ginkgos.
"""I decided on that day, just that day, I would be your daughter for the last time."""
"""You don't sound fine. Why don't you write to him?"""
"Mother annoyed me at times with her questions, yet it was a strange delight- to be annoyed at all, rather than experience the stiff and formal silence I'd grown up with."
"""No matter what happens, life goes on, doesn't it?"""
"""I wish you both a better afterlife,"" I whispered as I dug a little hole in the earth and slipped the letter in. Soothing the soil back over, I remained still, my heart too heavy to move."
I prayed he wouldn't become one more person I would need to remember.
"Too many had died, their lives gone like a flash of lightning, consumed by another's rage."
"I was too tired to weep, or to think of all that awaited me."
"Of our fragile existence, yet out determination to survive. Of secret pains, and the yearning for love."
Seven years of studying ought to have prepared me for this moment. Yet I had never saved anyone's life before. 
"Once I set my mind on a task, I will not stop until I complete it."
"He was so still. It terrified me- a terror that pierced the dizzying haze of exhaustion as I staggered forward in small, painful steps."
My mother was the only one who loved me. She always told me how she loved me since the very moment I was born.
Human perseverance often surprises me.
"""Most of us believe that we are not capable of murder… until it happens to us."""
"""Perhaps we both didn't think it's possible,"" I said, ""that a woman could be so cruel. Perhaps when she was born, her mother dreamt of dragons, too."""
It Is those you love that make a wretched life worth living.
